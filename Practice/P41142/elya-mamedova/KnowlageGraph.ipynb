However, this promise was broken, allowing only upper-class citizens of Oregon into the party.\\n\\nIn \"The Golf War,\" the Pines family and Soos Ramirez|Soos drove Pacifica home from Ye Royal Discount Putt Hutt as a nice gesture by Mabel Pines|Mabel, since her parents hadn\\'t arrived to pick her up and it was starting to rain. After Pacifica opened the gates to her home, Dipper Pines|Dipper and Mabel saw how exquisite it was and agreed they should have charged her for the taco Mabel gave her.\\n\\nIn \"Northwest Mansion Mystery,\" it was revealed that the mansion was haunted by one of its Archibald Corduroy|original creators, a lumberjack who had sworn vengeance on the Northwests. The Northwests hired Dipper to get rid of the spirit by trapping it into a silver mirror, but the spirit escaped by breaking the mirror. The spirit then returned to the mansion and started turning people into wood, refusing to stop until a Northwest opened the party gates up to the public like their ancestors promised. Once everyone at the party was turned to wood, including Dipper, Pacifica opened the party to the public, appeasing the spirit and lifting the curse.\\n\\nIn \"The Stanchurian Candidate,\" the mansion briefly appears on a map of Gravity Falls.\\n\\nIn \"Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,\" the Northwest family loses their fortune, resulting in Preston having to sell the mansion in order to stay wealthy. Meanwhile, Old Man McGucket acquires wealth by marketing his inventions to the US government; and after spotting the mansion for sale, he purchases it.

However, this promise was broken, allowing only upper-class citizens of Oregon into the party.\\n\\nIn \"The Golf War,\" the Pines family and Soos Ramirez|Soos drove Pacifica home from Ye Royal Discount Putt Hutt as a nice gesture by Mabel Pines|Mabel, since her parents hadn\\'t arrived to pick her up and it was starting to rain. After Pacifica opened the gates to her home, Dipper Pines|Dipper and Mabel saw how exquisite it was and agreed they should have charged her for the taco Mabel gave her.\\n\\nIn \"Northwest Mansion Mystery,\" it was revealed that the mansion was haunted by one of its Archibald Corduroy|original creators, a lumberjack who had sworn vengeance on the Northwests. The Northwests hired Dipper to get rid of the spirit by trapping it into a silver mirror, but the spirit escaped by breaking the mirror. The spirit then returned to the mansion and started turning people into wood, refusing to stop until a Northwest opened the party gates up to the public like their ancestors promised. Once everyone at the party was turned to wood, including Dipper, Pacifica opened the party to the public, appeasing the spirit and lifting the curse.\\n\\nIn \"The Stanchurian Candidate,\" the mansion briefly appears on a map of Gravity Falls.\\n\\nIn \"Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,\" the Northwest family loses their fortune, resulting in Preston having to sell the mansion in order to stay wealthy. Meanwhile, Old Man McGucket acquires wealth by marketing his inventions to the US government; and after spotting the mansion for sale, he purchases it.
