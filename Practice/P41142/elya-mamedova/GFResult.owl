However, this promise was broken, allowing only upper-class citizens of Oregon into the party.

In "The Golf War," the Pines family and Soos Ramirez|Soos drove Pacifica home from Ye Royal Discount Putt Hutt as a nice gesture by Mabel Pines|Mabel, since her parents hadn't arrived to pick her up and it was starting to rain. After Pacifica opened the gates to her home, Dipper Pines|Dipper and Mabel saw how exquisite it was and agreed they should have charged her for the taco Mabel gave her.

In "Northwest Mansion Mystery," it was revealed that the mansion was haunted by one of its Archibald Corduroy|original creators, a lumberjack who had sworn vengeance on the Northwests. The Northwests hired Dipper to get rid of the spirit by trapping it into a silver mirror, but the spirit escaped by breaking the mirror. The spirit then returned to the mansion and started turning people into wood, refusing to stop until a Northwest opened the party gates up to the public like their ancestors promised. Once everyone at the party was turned to wood, including Dipper, Pacifica opened the party to the public, appeasing the spirit and lifting the curse.

In "The Stanchurian Candidate," the mansion briefly appears on a map of Gravity Falls.

In "Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls," the Northwest family loses their fortune, resulting in Preston having to sell the mansion in order to stay wealthy. Meanwhile, Old Man McGucket acquires wealth by marketing his inventions to the US government; and after spotting the mansion for sale, he purchases it.

In "Weirdmageddon Part 1," during the cold open, Bill introduces Paci-Fire with the rest of his friends to the residents of Gravity Falls, Oregon|Gravity Falls. Afterwards, on Main Street, Paci-Fire and the other demons watch Bill turn Ford into a golden statue and taunt Dipper Pines|Dipper before burning the Journal (disambiguation)|''Journals''. Later in the episode, Paci-Fire is seen drinking Time Punch with Keyhole and enjoying the "V.I.P." party Bill is having at the Fearamid until Time Baby and the Time Paradox Avoidance Enforcement Squadron|Time Police crash the party. To the demons' delight, Bill vaporizes Time Baby and his squadron. The party then continues as Paci-Fire and the others rejoice over Time Baby's presumed death.

In "Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality," Paci-Fire and the rest of Bill's friends attempt to leave Gravity Falls to spread their chaos across the world, only to collide with an invisible barrier. Paci-Fire complains that it might have broken something, but Bill angrily tells it to "walk it off."

In "Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls," Paci-Fire participates in the battle against the Shacktron. Following Bill Cipher's defeat,he was sucked back to the Nightmare Realm|nightmare realm along with his comrades.""" ;
